This project is a precision line follower robot built for both stability and speed, using analog reflectance sensing and robust motor control. It features the Pololu QTR-8A analog sensor, L298N motor driver, 12V-rated 1500 RPM N20 motors, and a 12V 4200mAh LiPo battery for consistent high-power delivery.

Main Components:
QTR-8A Analog Reflectance Sensor: Offers 8 infrared sensors for accurate detection of line edges. Outputs analog signals that allow fine position calculation using techniques like weighted average or PID control.

L298N Dual H-Bridge Motor Driver: Controls two DC motors independently. Handles the 12V power directly from the battery to drive the motors with adjustable speed (via PWM) and direction.

12V 1500 RPM N20 Gear Motors: Compact, high-efficiency brushed DC motors designed for 12V operation. Offer a good balance of torque and speed, ideal for competitive or hobbyist line follower robots.

12V 4200mAh LiPo Battery: Supplies stable, high-current power for both motors and electronics. Capable of long-duration operation, suitable for extended runs and testing.
